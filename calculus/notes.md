=Calculus=
Calculus (Greek: Very small rock). The study of rate of change, interpreted as slopes or curves.

Two kinds: Differential and Integral.

==Differential Calculus==
Slopes of lines
The derivative is used to find the slopes of lines
In a curve the slope varies
Zooming in on a curve far enough to call it a slope (straight line)

Taking the derivative by differentiating
Mapping the value of something over time as a straight line. I.e. a catapulted pig starts with a positive vertical velocity that decreases constantly and becomes negative mid-flight, until finally reaching zero when the pig hits the ground. The flight path is a parabola (curve), while the vertical velocity can be mapped to a straight line (slope).

Slope formula = rise over run = rise divided by run

==Integral Calculus==
Area under a curve
